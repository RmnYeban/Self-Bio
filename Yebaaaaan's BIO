As you can see from my bio, I am currently a 2nd year student taking up ECE as a major in Engineering in UST.
I live in Miguelin St. in Sampaloc, Manila; 15 minutes of a walk from my college.
My hobbies are playing games and listening to music
As for my preferences, i'm more of the kind that prefers horror as favorite genre especially when it comes to movies and mostly games in general.
In reality, I am the type of guy that appears to be reserved on the outside but once I think that I am comfortable talking to a particular person,
i become more friendly with them.
Even if I am admittedly shy in real life, I try to make up for it by joining student organizations in UST like NECES.
I am part of the Logistics team in NECES because I heard that's where most people become close with their orgmates and form connections.
Recently, ever since I recently bought an arduino kit, I've been trying to do different kinds of arduino projects I find on the Internet.
The ones that I have tried can be found in my other repositories.
I'm not proficient in terms of arduino programming yet but I try to understand the code that I've obtained.
I am currently single. DI AKO MARUNONG MAMBABAE OKAY
I am desperate to paricipate in the #HuntForPaskuhanDate2019 :D"; \n
